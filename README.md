# Sitecore SOLR on Startup
A Sitecore initialization pipeline that automatically creates SOLR cores on the target SOLR server - similar to the Sitecore Lucene functionality.

## Getting Started
### NuGet Package
`Install-Package Svenkle.SitecoreSolrOnStartup`

## FAQ
### Can I use this on SOLR version X?
Yes. Just add the default configuration files for your SOLR version into the App_Data folder following the versioning convention. The folder name must match exactly to that of your target SOLR instance.

### Will you support SOLR running in X and Y configuration?
Possibly. The supported instances may grow over time - please feel free to develop your own and submit a PR.
